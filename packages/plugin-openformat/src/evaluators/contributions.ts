const contributionTemplate = `TASK: Analyze Message Contribution
Review the following conversation and determine if the message contains a meaningful contribution.

Recent Messages:
{{recentMessages}}

Consider the following contribution types:

High-Value Contributions (150-500 points):
- Solving complex problems for other users
- Creating comprehensive tutorials or guides
- Providing detailed technical explanations
- Leading productive brainstorming sessions

Medium-Value Contributions (50-150 points):
- Sharing relevant resources or documentation
- Answering questions with detailed explanations
- Contributing substantial ideas to discussions
- Helping debug simple problems

Low-Value Contributions (10-50 points):
- Basic helpful responses
- Sharing simple tips
- Participating constructively in discussions
- Validating others' solutions

Minimal Engagement (1-10 points):
- Asking well-formed questions
- Introducing themselves meaningfully
- Following up on discussions constructively
- First-time participation in topics

Not Considered Contributions (0 points):
- Generic greetings (gm, hello, etc.)
- Single word/emoji responses
- Off-topic messages
- Spam or low-effort posts

Consider these factors when evaluating:

Message Quality:
- Level of detail and effort
- Technical accuracy or helpfulness
- Relevance to the discussion
- Originality of contribution

Community Response:
- Substantive follow-up messages
- Specific thank you messages
- Multiple positive reactions
- Evidence of actual help provided

Context Evaluation:
- Previous discussion history
- Time since last similar contribution
- Overall discussion relevance
- Community need for the contribution
